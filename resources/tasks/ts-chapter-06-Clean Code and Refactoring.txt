JT-06 Clean Code and Refactoring


Theory part:

Get acquainted with book "Clean Code" by Robert C Martin, we really recommend to read it in nearest future.

Study our project Clean code rules from: 
"PMT-CleanCodeRules-180321-1650-48.pdf", 

Find and study materials on clean code and code refactoring. 

Here are some good links:

Practical part:
Clean and refactor your code according to Clean Code recommendations.

1. Create several classes with methods that prove in practice all the best recommendations of Clean Code rules: class and
 method names, comments, literals, code logic etc.
2. Using clean code rules from pdf "PMT-CleanCodeRules-180321-1650-48.pdf", refactor and clean your code and improve your
code quality on all the previous training chapters implementations and correct them according to the new studied rules.
3. Using Idea "Inspect Code" tool test and fix your training project issues and possible bugs.
4. Apply "DEP_IDEA_profile.xml" inspections profile in Idea. Rescan project again and clean all the issues.
5. Install SonarLint and SonarQube Idea plugins and scan project for issues and fix them. Compare the inspections results.
6. Make a comparison between all tools and come with a recommendations for best tools to keep code clean.
7. For all next chapters scan and analyze code for issues and keep the project clean.


Additional challenge: Try to install and configure SonarQube to your project on your local pc. Run test report on your
code on issues and bugs and fix them.
