Practical Part

I. Given a list of integer with elements from 1 to 16, use lambdas and streams:
1.	Filter the elements divisible by 4 , after add 1 to the result. Print the list.
2.
    a. Filter the elements that are divisible by 2 or 3.
    b. Create a string from the list in the next form: Aelement0B Aelement1B Aelement2B

II. Given a list of words:
1.	Print them with a space before
2.
    a.	Put “!” at the end of each word
    b.	Replace “i” with  “eye”
    c.	Make them uppercase
    d.	Collect the result into a list
3.
    a.	Take the words that has the length <= 4
    b.	Take the elements that contains “e”
    c.	Take the first word from the result
4.	Make a single String from the list using .reduce
5.	Find the number of characters used in the list
6.	Filter the list so it will contains only the elements that contains a single “h” . Use only stream functions.


III. Demonstrate the usage of Optional class. Be creative!
IV. Write examples of some more Java 8 features and strengthen your knowledge at this language level.

Each point (1,2,3..) should represent a different stream.
