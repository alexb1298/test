Practical Part

Create a To-Do List web application which has the following features:
1. The user can check all the previously added to-do items which have a deadline and a short description, displayed in a list/table.
2. The user can add new to-do items by clicking on the '+' button.
3. The user can delete to-do items by clicking the 'Delete' button/icon near each to-do item.
*Optional: display to-do items in descending order by deadline.

- The application should have a simple but user-friendly UI styled with some basic CSS and should be deployed with Apache Tomcat.
- For each feature implement separate endpoints that call a Java Servlet.
- Store and display data in-memory using Java Collections, no database needed.
- For the first feature provide some default data.
- For the UI implementation use JSP and HTML pages.

The application should have user-friendly output, should be well organized, should respect Clean Code rules and handle errors.
