1. Create four different methods that will connect to Postgres DB and have try-catch blocks:
	the first method will try to connect with a wrong address url,
	the second one with try to connect with a wrong username,
	the third one with try with wrong password,
	the fourth connect with correct parameters and make a select request with JDBC from the table.
